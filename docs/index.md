# Tari Hackathon
Welcome to the Tari Hackathon website! Here you will find all the resources necessary to begin your journey developing apps for the Ootle.

The objective of the Hackathon is simple - develop an app that utilises the Ootle. Whether a game, some unique idea or a more "traditional" blockchain service, we hope you'll experiment and see what works (and what doesn't).

We will take through a number of lessons: 

1. Common calls in Tari.js and interaction with some built-in templates 
2. An introduction to Tari Templates and how one develops and deploys their own templates.
3. Ideas for apps, some existing example projects and links to more detailed documentation.

To get started, head to the "Hello World" page

    A step-by-step guide to making a "Hello World" Ootle app, which will help you set up a working development environment and introduces the fundamental concepts such as the Ootle Wallet, Tari.JS Library and interaction with templates (smart contracts).
