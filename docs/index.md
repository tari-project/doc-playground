# Tari Hackathon
Welcome to the Tari Hackathon website! Here you will find all the resources necessary to begin your journey developing apps for the Ootle.

The objective of the Hackathon is simple - develop an app that utilises the Ootle. Whether a game, some unique idea or a more "traditional" blockchain service, we hope you'll experiment and see what works (and what doesn't).

We will take through a number of lessons: 

1. Common calls in Tari.js and interaction with some built-in templates 
2. An introduction to Tari Templates and how one develops and deploys their own templates.
3. Ideas for apps, some existing example projects and links to more detailed documentation.

To get started, head to the "Hello World" page

Welcome to Tari's Hello World project! 

Here, we will take you through the main steps of developing on the Ootle by instructing you how to build a basic web application that uses the Ootle. We'll cover the following topics:

- Setting up a React web project
- Setting up a Ootle wallet to use with your project
- How to incorporate the Tari.js library
- How to connect your wallet to the Ootle
- How to call on a pre-existing template 

At the end of this, you will have have the following:

- An Ootle Wallet and web application that allows you to initiate a counter and increment it, while being able to display the current counter value.





This site will take you through the process of creating a simple 'Hello World' project that will teach you how to set up your development environment and use the Ootle. Once you've made this basic project, you can proceed to some more advanced topics and functionality, with some common examples
