At the end of this tutorial, you will have achieved the following:

- Learnt what the Tari.js library is and how to use it to interact in a basic fashion with the Ootle.
- Learnt about the structure of the Ootle and how it stores information.
- Learnt about templates, which are a form of smart contract.

To begin with the Hello Ootle project, you will need a couple of items set up first:

- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - where you'll be coding your project.

Proceed to the next section to set up your Ootle Wallet. If you want to proceed the sections in order, you can do so by using the navigation links at the bottom of the page. All sections for the Hello Ootle project are also available on the left.
