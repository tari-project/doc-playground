# Installing your IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides various tools and functions for editing code and managing development projects. There are many different IDEs available for use, but we will be using VS Code for the guide.

Rather than explain the exact process for installing VS Code, it is best to follow the official instructions for installing VS Code, as the installation steps may change over time and differ for different environments.

Use one of the following links below, depending on your operating system, to install VS Code:

- Linux: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
- MacOS: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
- Windows: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)

Follow the instructions, then launch VS Code to confirm it’s working as intended. Next, we’ll install the prerequisites for working on Tari projects.

## Installing Development Prerequisites
While an IDE is generally the only thing you would require if you were programming your own small projects, modern development environments rely heavily on several applications and services that improves the overall process of development:

For this purposes of this Hello Ootle project, we only require the following to be installed in addition to our IDE:


- [Nvm (for Node.js and npm).](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- (Optional for MacOS users but highly useful): [Homebrew.](https://brew.sh/)

It’s best to follow the official instructions for installing these items. We’ve linked to each one’s current installation page as a quick reference. Also note that you might already have some of these prerequisites installed. You can also review the Tari home page for additional requirements

## VS Code Layout

When you first open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, you’re greeted with a clean and simple interface designed to help you work with code. If this is the first time you've used VS Code, or any IDE, we highly recommend checking out the [Getting Started page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started) for an overview of the layout and some useful tips before proceeding to the next section.
