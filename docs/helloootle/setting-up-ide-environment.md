# Installing your IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides various tools and functions for editing code and managing development projects. There are many different IDEs available for use, but we will be using VS Code for the guide.

Rather than explain the exact process for installing VS Code, it is best to follow the official instructions for installing VS Code, as the installation steps may change over time and differ for different environments.

Use one of the following links below, depending on your operating system, to install VS Code:

- Linux: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
- MacOS: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
- Windows: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)

Follow the instructions, then launch VS Code to confirm it’s working as intended. Next, we’ll install the prerequisites for working on Tari projects.

## Installing Development Prerequisites
While an IDE is generally the only thing you would require if you were programming your own small projects, modern development environments rely heavily on several applications and services that improves the overall process of development:

Below we’ve listed several items which will be useful to have when working with Tari projects.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Nvm (for Node.js and npm).](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- MacOS: [Homebrew.](https://brew.sh/)
- [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) and make
- [OpenSSL](https://docs.openssl.org/3.2/man7/ossl-guide-introduction/#getting-and-installing-openssl)
- [Perl][https://learn.perl.org/installing/]
- LLVM
- Tor (Optional)

It’s best to follow the official instructions for installing these items. We’ve linked to each one’s current installation page as a quick reference. Also note that you might already have some of these prerequisites installed. You can also review the Tari home page for additional requirements
